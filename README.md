# 📝 Description

One key aspect of Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes, which involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales. As a Lead Data Analyst at a company like Microsoft, you'll work with various datasets and tables, using advanced SQL skills to analyze data and provide valuable insights that can improve company operations and explain sudden changes in key metrics.

# 🔍 Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis

You will work with a table named job_data with the following columns:

job_id: Unique identifier of jobs

actor_id: Unique identifier of actor

event: The type of event (decision/skip/transfer)

language: The language of the content

time_spent: Time spent reviewing the job (in seconds)

org: The organization of the actor

ds: The date in yyyy/mm/dd format (stored as text)

## Tasks:

### Jobs Reviewed Over Time:

Objective: Calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.

Task: Write an SQL query to calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day.

### Throughput Analysis:

Objective: Calculate the 7-day rolling average of throughput (number of events per second).

Task: Write an SQL query for the 7-day rolling average. Explain the preference between the daily metric or 7-day rolling average.

### Language Share Analysis:

Objective: Calculate the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days.

Task: Write an SQL query to compute the percentage share of each language.

### Duplicate Rows Detection:

Objective: Identify duplicate rows in the data.

Task: Write an SQL query to display duplicate rows from the job_data table.

# 🔍 Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spike

You will work with three tables:

users: Contains one row per user, with descriptive information about their account.

events: Contains one row per event, where an event is an action a user has taken (e.g., login, messaging, search).

email_events: Contains events specific to the sending of emails.

## Tasks:

### Weekly User Engagement:
